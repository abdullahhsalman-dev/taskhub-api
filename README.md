ðŸ’¡ 1. DTO (Data Transfer Object)
DTOs are used to define the shape of the data that will be passed between layers of the application (e.g., controllers to services). They ensure that data is validated and transformed before being passed through the system.

Real-World Example:
For a User registration:

ts
Copy
// src/auth/dto/auth.dto.ts
import { IsEmail, IsNotEmpty, MinLength } from 'class-validator';

export class AuthDto {
@IsEmail() // Validates that the email is in proper format
@IsNotEmpty() // Ensures the email field is not empty
email: string;

@MinLength(6) // Ensures password has a minimum length
@IsNotEmpty()
password: string;
}
In this example, the AuthDto defines the required fields for a user registration, ensuring both validation (IsEmail, MinLength) and ensuring that no field is left empty.

ðŸ”’ 2. Guards
Guards are used to protect specific routes from unauthorized access. In NestJS, guards are implemented as middleware and can control access based on conditions (such as authentication, roles, etc.). Guards return a boolean indicating if the request can proceed or not.

Real-World Example: JWT Authentication Guard
The JwtAuthGuard will ensure that only authenticated users can access certain routes (i.e., require a valid JWT token).
// src/auth/guard/jwt.guard.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Injectable()
export class JwtGuard extends AuthGuard('jwt') {}
This simple JwtGuard uses Passport's JWT strategy to ensure that only requests with valid tokens can access protected routes. You can apply this guard to routes that require authentication:

ts
Copy
// src/task/task.controller.ts
import { JwtGuard } from '../auth/guard/jwt.guard';
import { UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';

@UseGuards(JwtGuard) // Protects this route with JWT authentication
@Controller('tasks')
export class TaskController {
// controller code here
}

- Guards and Strategies work together to protect the application. Guards prevent unauthorized access, and strategies define how the request should be validated.

Aspect | Guard | Strategy
Purpose | Protect routes and control access (e.g., authentication, authorization). | Define how authentication happens (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
Functionality | Determines if a request can proceed or not based on certain conditions (e.g., roles, token validation). | Defines how to extract and validate the authentication information.
Execution Time | Runs before the route handler to decide if the request can proceed. | Executes when a specific authentication method (strategy) is used to validate credentials.
Use Case | Protect routes (e.g., by checking if a user is authenticated or authorized). | Extract and validate authentication data (e.g., validate JWT or check username/password).
Example | JWTAuthGuard, RolesGuard, PermissionsGuard. | JwtStrategy, LocalStrategy, OAuthStrategy.
How It Works | Returns true (allow) or false (deny) to control the request flow. | Returns the validated user or null if authentication fails.
